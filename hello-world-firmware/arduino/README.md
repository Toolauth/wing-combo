# Example Arduino Firmware

> [!TIP]
> Arduino is not the firmware used by the [*Toolauth* project](https://github.com/Toolauth) creators.
> So, this firmware underwent less testing than the [ESPHome version](../esphome/). 
> Also, we recently had it 'touched up' by A.I. so you can use with caution....

This Arduino firmware is enough to show that all the hardware I/O is working for the board.

The Arduino IDE has opinions about libraries, so we have included a snapshot of all the needed ones and URLs to their origin. Open the folder, and have the Arduino IDE open the `io_test.ino` file to get this working on your board.
