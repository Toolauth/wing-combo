These are all united in their service \nto the Adafruit Feather board. Thinkinc about this design as a whole. it is our past experience\nand makerspace spirit that guided us towards making this a Feather Wing rather than integrate\nthe ESP32 on-board. If the microcontroller is removable, it is easier to program and you can \nreplace a 'problematic feather' for any reason, without needing to rewire the tools. "
