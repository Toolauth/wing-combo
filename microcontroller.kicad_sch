  (text "This shows the relationships between all components running at 3.3VDC or 5VDC on the board. These are all on the 'low voltage' \nside of the board. These are all united in their service to the ESP32-DEVKITC-V4+ board, but that board itself is removable \n(for ease of programming and switching out the controller, without needing to rewire the tools).

There is also a 3.3V \nlinear regulator to power these daughter \nboards, without placing more draw on the \nESP32's onboard linear regulator (this \nincludes powering the ADE7953).\n\nThere is also a USB plug to provide \naccess to 5VDC - this is primarily \navailable so a panel mount USB power \nport can be added. MakeHaven can \nforesee wanting to add an external \nESP32 to control an E-Paper display, \nand this USB port could provide easy \naccess to power.\n\n"
