    <h2>Gerber markup</h2>
    <p>
        This Gerber screenshot has been marked-up to show steady-state current supply for the tool or contactor. 
        If you look closely, the hand-scribbled lines show the current-path on visible traces. The straight lines
        show the current passing through some kind of component, rather than the PCB itself. With a little more 
        sleuthing: you can probably even trace out the branch of the 'Hot' circuit that is basically only used for
        an instant to start current flowing to the stage 2 (Omron) relay's coil.
