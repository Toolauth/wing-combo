    <h1>E-Stop arrangements:</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Setting up an E-Stop switch</h2>
    <p>An E-Stop must be built from a multi-part switch system.         Each E-Stop should be comprised of two N-ON switches rated for more than 4A AC current, an indicator LED, and a low-voltage N-OFF switch.</p>
    <p>What is shown below is how the two low-voltage components [lamp and switch] must be configured. The three outbound wires must be soldered to work with a JST connector. Their </p>

    <hr/>
    <h2>Two E-Stops</h2>
    <p>This configuration is best for when you have an E-Stop on the controller box, and want another mounted closer to where the user will actually be working. A good example is having a second E-Stop right on the front of a Bridgeport Mill.</p>
    <p>The control box's E-Stop [A] should be plugged in at all the green locations. The secondary E-Stop should be plugged in to all the blue locations.</p>

    <hr/>
    <h2>One E-Stop</h2>
    <p><mark>This configuration may be the most common.</mark> There is an E-Stop on the controller box, and none other.</p>
    <p>The control box's E-Stop [A] should be plugged in at all the green locations. Jumpers will need placed where the blue 'U' shapes show connections for E-Stop B. Do not use the E-Stop-B JST plug.</p>
    <img src="img/v1.3-one-estop.png" width="100%">
    <hr/>
    <h2>No E-Stops</h2>
    <p>This configuration is only for the very safest of tools, when the control box is pperhaps undersized.</p>
    <p>Jumpers will need placed where the blue 'U' shapes show connections for E-Stops A & B. Do not use the E-Stop-A or E-Stop-B JST plugs.</p>

    <h1>Current Sensor</h1>
    <p>The CT current sensor will be plugged into a 1/8" jack in this location. The current sensor itself should be of <a href="https://a.co/d/4anaNE2">this</a> kind of simple split-ring inductive sensor. The exact current rating of the sensor is not critical, but should be slightly above the value of the tool's circuit breaker, adjustments can be made in the firmware `offset` setting. [30A is a good fit for most.]</p>
    <p>The current sensor should be clamped around the 'hot' line headed out to the tool, from the contactor.</p>

    <h1>I2C Card Reader</h1>
    <p>The RFID card reader connects using one of the two available I2C connections (it does not matter which of these).</p>
    <p>The PN532 board should be like those shown <a href="https://a.co/d/duoIX52">here</a>. They should be configured for I2C communication (switch DIP as needed) and have wires soldered to leav the flattest-possible surface to mount the board.</p>

    <hr/>
    <h1>Bypass Key</h1>
    <p>The controller box will need a bypass key-switch, such as those shown <a href="https://a.co/d/hHKVJxG">here</a>. This switch will need to conenct to a 2-pin JST conenctor as shown on the board.</p>
    <div>

    <hr/>
    <h1>Soldered-on Components</h1>
    <p>two components will need soldered by the end user.</p>
    <p>The 5V transformer will need soldered into place in the location marked "PS1" on the board.</p>
    <p>The Stage 2 relay will need soldered on where indicated. It must be an "Omron MY2-02" relay to fit, but can be rated for 110VAC or 220VAC.</p>
    <p>It is advised, that after soldering on these components (and arranging the E-Stops) you should set the DIP pins, as appropriate.</p>

    <h1>Other Connections</h1>
    <p>There are a handful of other connections that must be made of the right side of the baord, to the mains-level control components that are panel-mounted on the box.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Incoming Power</h2>
    <p>The power lines must be connected as shown, with the correct polarity for any single-phase applications. 'H' for the Hot line. 'N' for the neutral line.</p>
    <img src="img/v1.3-mains.png" width="100%">
    <hr/>
    <h2>Out to Contactor</h2>
    <p>The external contactor should be mounted in the controller box, but the two wires coming out here should be used to activte it. These lines should only need to supply a relatively small current to control the state of the contactor.</p>
    <img src="img/v1.3-contactor.png" width="100%">
    <hr/>
    <h2>Mains User I/O</h2>
    <p>The green light, green button, and red button should all connect here as shown.</p>
